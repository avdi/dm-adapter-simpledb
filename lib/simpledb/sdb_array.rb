        # This is a little screwy. DataMapper has a fixed list of values it
        # considers primitives, and it insists that the value that comes out of
        # a type's .dump() method MUST match one of these types. For SimpleDB
        # Array is effectively a primitive because of the way it stores values,
        # but DM doesn't include Array in it's list of valid primtive types. So
        # we need to return an object which IS considered a primitive - in this
        # case a plain 'ole Ruby Object. In order to convey the actual array
        # value to the backend, we tack on a #to_ary method which returns the
        # array data. RightAws calls Array() on all values before writing them,
        # which in turn calls #to_ary(), and winds up with the correct data. In
        # effect we are sneaking the array data through DataMapper inside a
        # singleton method.
